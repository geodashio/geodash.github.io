### What is GeoDash?

GeoDash is a modern web framework and approach for quickly producing visualizations of geospatial data. The name comes from "geospatial dashboard".

The framework is built to be extremely extensible. You can use GeoDash server (an implementation), the front-end framework, backend code, or just the Gulp pipeline. Have fun!

### Open Source

GeoDash was created in 2016 and is developed in the open by a global community of developers.  The platform is built on a [fully opensource stack]({{ site.baseurl }}/tech), including the widely used [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org/).
